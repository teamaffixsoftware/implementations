Affiliate Side
The affiliate side of Affix Services includes the use of instant messaging.
We as project maintainers are incapable of reading the majority of our Users’ content. Because of this, as the User, you are responsible for everything that you send to our servers, whether you are logged into your own affiliation, another User’s affiliation, or if you are not logged in. If your communication with our servers have malicious intent and/or fall under "computer hacking", your account will be banned, and legal pursuit may take place.


Our Pledge
In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:
Using welcoming and inclusive language
Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
Focusing on what is best for the community
Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:
The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
Personal or political attacks
Public or private harassment
Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

Our Responsibilities
Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.
Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Your Responsibilities and Acknowledgements
Creating an affiliation with Affix Team is different from an account held with any other public organization over the internet. An affiliation is a virtual document which will be kept as a record of your acceptance to our terms, and upon acceptance the user will be given full access to the affiliate side of Affix Services. Upon all changes of our TOS, the users will be prompted for their acceptances. Users are only allowed to use our products if they accept and are familiar with the Affix Services Online Terms and Conditions. Giving away the passwords or two-factor authentication codes to your Affix Services affiliation, or any E2E code used in your chats is considered an instance of unacceptable behavior, and above all a risk to your own security and safety. Our services have built-in algorithms for detecting an attempted publicization of the respective affiliation’s (belonging to the User) password or two factor authentication code, and for preventing the export of them.

Scope
This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at teamaffix.contact@gmail.com. The project team will review and investigate all complaints, and will respond in a way that it deems appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.
Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.
​
​
Any production or use of a client which impersonates the identification, authentication, or any data submitted by an approved Affix Software Program is forbidden. Impersonation of other users (without the User’s specific permission and without identifying oneself as themself) is forbidden . Users are NOT allowed to modify any Team Affix file in any way, and any modification is forbidden. Users however may submit requests via the Team Affix website https://teamaffix.wixsite.com/affix .
